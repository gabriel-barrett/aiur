Satisfying a compiled body recovers its
source evaluation, provided every enabled call is justified by `calls`.
This lemma does not assume anything about recursive function evaluation.

Construct a simultaneous assignment for
one compiled body. Inactive branches must be satisfiable without evaluating them.
